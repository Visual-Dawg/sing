## ⚠️ Early Alpha

Sing is still in Alpha and does not support auto-updates yet. Future updates might need you to resync your library, but it does never modify your music files.

### ToDo

- Drag and Drop support
- Order playlists
- Sorting
- Smart Playlists
- Android sync
- much more

### Get started

1. Install Node.js
2. Install Git LFS
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run build:prisma` (Rerun this when changing `schema.prisma`)

### Commands

- `npm run start`: Start app in dev mode ( But better use the VS Code task `devMode`)
- `npm run build`: Build

Tests are currently not maintained. But will be again.
